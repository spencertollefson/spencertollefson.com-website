<p>My name is Spencer Tollefson. My current job is Peace Corps
Volunteer in a small town in Costa Rica doing Community
Economic Development. I’m digging into data science, coding,
and other tangential fields head first. DISCLAIMER! I have no formal training in programming
- at the end of 2017 I began self-teaching myself Python,
listening to related podcasts, and digging into a whole bunch
of different online resources in order to learn a thing or two.
<br>
<br>
My goals with this blog are to jot down what I’ve been up to, what I’ve
been learning, and use it as a diary in a sense. If you find yourself
here, don't run away! Welcome! Feel free to reach out with advice, comments,
questions, anything!
</p>
<h5>More Information</h5>
<br>
<p>For my entire life my ~relationship~ with data sets had been as
    follows: I highly valued and was fascinated by the information
    and potential advice hidden within them, but never had learned
    the correct skills and tools to effectively analyze them. I am
    changing that relationship. Now. With the surge of interest in
    programming (notably Python) and data science as a field, the
    lack of tools to learn this stuff no longer serves as a valid
    excuse.
    <br>
    <br>
    Anyway, about me. Born and raised in the Seattle area, currently
    living in Costa Rica. To keep moving I dabble in body weight
    exercises as well as some basic cardio+podcasts. Craft beer is
    divine. Supporter of theSeahawks, Mariners, and NBA fan (RIP Sonics).
    I love the Crash Course YouTube channel. I read non-fiction and
    Wikipedia for pleasure. I find it difficult to focus on comedy
    TV shows – I could be learning something instead! Since mid-2017
    I shifted my diet to eating mostly unprocessed plants. Worth it.
    Finally, I organize via maintaining Google Keep lists of nearly
    everything and I really like beer.
