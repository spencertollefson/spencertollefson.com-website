        <h3>About</h3>
            <p>My name is Spencer Tollefson. My current job is Peace Corps
                Volunteer in a small town in Costa Rica doing Community
                Economic Development. I’m digging into data science, coding,
                and other tangential fields head first. DISCLAIMER! I have no formal training in programming
                - at the end of 2017 I began self-teaching myself Python,
                listening to related podcasts, and digging into a whole bunch
                of different online resources in order to learn a thing or two.
                <br>
                <br>
                My goals with this blog are to jot down what I’ve been up to, what I’ve
                been learning, and use it as a diary in a sense. If you find yourself
                here, don't run away! Welcome! Feel free to reach out with advice, comments,
                questions, anything!
            </p>
        <h3>More Information</h3>
            <br>
            <p>For my entire life my ~relationship~ with data sets had been as
                follows: I highly valued and was fascinated by the information
                and potential advice hidden within them, but never had learned
                the correct skills and tools to effectively analyze them. I am
                changing that relationship. Now. With the surge of interest in
                programming (notably Python) and data science as a field, the
                lack of tools to learn this stuff no longer serves as a valid
                excuse.

                Anyway, about me. Born and raised in the Seattle area, currently
                living in Costa Rica. To keep moving I dabble in body weight
                exercises as well as some basic cardio+podcasts. Craft beer is
                divine. Supporter of theSeahawks, Mariners, and NBA fan (RIP Sonics).
                I love the Crash Course YouTube channel. I read non-fiction and
                Wikipedia for pleasure. I find it difficult to focus on comedy
                TV shows – I could be learning something instead! Since mid-2017
                I shifted my diet to eating mostly unprocessed plants. Worth it.
                Finally, I organize via maintaining Google Keep lists of nearly
                everything and I really like beer.
