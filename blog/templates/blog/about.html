        <h3>About</h3>
            <p>My name is Spencer Tollefson. My current job is Peace Corps
                Volunteer in a small town in Costa Rica doing Community
                Economic Development. I’m digging into data science, coding,
                and other tangential fields head first. DISCLAIMER! I have no formal training in programming
                - at the end of 2017 I began self-teaching myself Python,
                listening to related podcasts, and digging into a whole bunch
                of different online resources in order to learn a thing or two.
                <br>
                <br>
                My goals with this blog are to jot down what I’ve been up to, what I’ve
                been learning, and use it as a diary in a sense. If you find yourself
                here, don't run away! Welcome! Feel free to reach out with advice, comments,
                questions, anything!
            </p>
        <h3>More Information</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I’ve had this ~relationship~ with data sets for a long time: I
                highly respected the information and actionable advice they may hold, but
                have not equipped myself with the tools to analyze them. I aim to change
                that. Now. With the surge of interest in programming (notably Python)
                and data science as a field, the lack of tools to learn this stuff
                no longer serves as a valid excuse.
                <br>

                Anyway, about me. Born and raised in the Seattle area, currently
                living in Costa Rica. I like staying fit via body weight exercises as well
                as some basic cardio + podcasts. I’m a Seahawks, Mariners, and NBA fan
                (RIP Sonics). I love the Crash Course YouTube channel. I read
                non-fiction and Wikipedia for pleasure. I find it difficult to focus on
                comedy TV shows – I could be learning something instead! Since mid-2017 Finally, I eat
                a lot of plants, keep Google Keep lists of nearly everything and really like beer.
