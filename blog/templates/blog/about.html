    <h5>Who: Spencer Tollefson</h5>
    <p>
    Who is Spencer Tollefson? He's a human being aspiring to land a data scientist job.
    Previously working for the Peace Corps in Costa Rica (Pura Vida!), he returned and completed a data science
    bootcamp with
    <a href="https://thisismetis.com">Metis</a>. You can check out projects from that bootcamp in the
    <a href="https://www.spencertollefson.com/blog/">Blog</a> section. Relatedly, you can try out a model he
    created to predict likelihood of filing a successful TSA claim for damaged or lost property in the
    the <a href="https://www.spencertollefson.com/tsa-claim-outcome-prediction/">TSA claim prediction app</a>.
    Attributes and
    preferences include: he's a Seattle-ite, big into craft beer, doesn't mind the rain too much,
    and as demonstrated by this website, he's into tech. But hang on, honesty first policy here:
    Spencer only began learning to code in October 2017 (He's decent at Excel
    though, that counts for something right?!) To help him learn any and
    everything about data science, he has been chowing down on blogs, podcasts,
    tutorials, videos, and more as if they were sweet Costa Rican rambutans.
    <br><br>
    Non-tech stuff? Dabbles in body weight fitness exercises and loves long walks - not kidding!
    Watches, analyzes, and debates NBA (Continually hoping for the return of the Sonics!). Subscribes to the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse">Crash Course</a> YouTube channel.
    Reads non-fiction and <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> for pleasure.
    Eats mostly "unprocessed" plants. Finally, Spencer organizes his life by
    maintaining lists on <a href="https://keep.google.com">Google Keep</a> of
    everything he can quantify.

    <h5>You</h5>
    <p>
    The more the merrier! Spencer intends to mainly write about Python and data
    science related topics here, so if that is your kind of thing that's great!
    If not, well he has a bunch of other interests as well - but he won't be
    writing about them much here. The target audience of this site consists
    of fellow coders, data scientists, potential employers, friends, family
    pets - why not?
    </p>

    <h5>The Site</h5>
    <p>
    So what is this website and why did Spencer make it? Not going to beat around the
    bush here - his primary reason for building this site is for himself. He is
    using it for motivation, to track what he's learned, to keep a tech journal,
    and to expand on topics that capture his attention. Of course
    that's not the only reason though. The site in itself is a project - Spencer's first
    (and perhaps last) web dev project - and he's learned a ton every step
    of creating this baby. Additionally, Spencer wants to connect with like-minded
    people and maintain a portfolio for <i>potential</i> opportunities.
    <br><br>
    He built this site in Python using the <a href="https://djangoproject.com">Django</a>
    framework for architecture and the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>
    Content Delivery Network for support in the layout. It's deployed via <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.
    It was quite the challenge, and Spencer doubts he'll ever make money being a web dev,
    but hey, besides what he learned he has something to show for it as well!
    </p>

    <h5>Get in Touch</h5>
    <p>
    You may notice there isn't commenting anywhere on the site. Twitter and
    email are the best ways to contact Spencer. Whether about something
    specific he wrote or anything else - he'd love to connect.
