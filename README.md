# spencertollefson.com-website
This is the repo for my personal website, spencertollefson.com. It's written by me, in Python, using the Django framework. I relied heavily on Djangogirls, the official Django documentation, the official Django tutorial, and numerous Youtube videos (especially Bucky) to get it off the ground. Thanks to all!


This is my repo for the website. I plan to use the website to blog my progress and learnings in the tech and data science worlds. I want to get this website to a low-bar level of satisfaction for myself. Hope I can learn a lot from building it!
