This is the repo for my personal website. It was coded and written by me, mostly in Python using the Django framework. I relied heavily on Djangogirls, the official Django documentation, the official Django tutorial, and numerous Youtube videos from various contributors to get it off the ground. Thanks to all!

I used the website to blog my progress and learnings in the tech and data science worlds from when I began coding through completion of the data science bootcamp I attended.
